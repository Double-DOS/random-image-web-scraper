Some politicians are telling us now isn't the time to speak frankly about Afghanistan. I'm not surprised.\n\nFor decades, elites told the American people we were winning this war. Later, they told us while Iraq was wrong, Afghanistan was the war worth fighting. They told us it was worth the lives, worth the money, worth the time. It was all lies.\n\nI\u2019ve always said one of the hardest parts of my deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan was coming home to my old neighborhood in Cole County, Missouri. Empty lots, abandoned buildings, a gutted Midwest. Our own communities look like battlefields after decades of economic warfare waged by corrupt politicians and massive corporations.\n\nThey spent $6.4 trillion in taxpayer dollars sending soldiers like me out to fight on a doomed mission to build up someone else's country \u2014 because they thought it made them look strong. Then they turned around and told us we can\u2019t \"afford\" nation-building right here at home.\n\nIt\u2019s time for this broken status quo to come to an end. We can\u2019t let the same crooks and liars who got us into these pointless wars continue calling the shots in Congress. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for U.S. Senate in Missouri. It\u2019s time for a people-powered movement to fight back.\n\nTogether, we can end these pointless wars and invest in our own communities.

Some politicians are telling us now isn't the time to speak frankly about Afghanistan. I'm not surprised.\n\nFor decades, elites told the American people we were winning this war. Later, they told us while Iraq was wrong, Afghanistan was the war worth fighting. They told us it was worth the lives, worth the money, worth the time. It was all lies.\n\nI\u2019ve always said one of the hardest parts of my deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan was coming home to my old neighborhood in Cole County, Missouri. Empty lots, abandoned buildings, a gutted Midwest. Our own communities look like battlefields after decades of economic warfare waged by corrupt politicians and massive corporations.\n\nThey spent $6.4 trillion in taxpayer dollars sending soldiers like me out to fight on a doomed mission to build up someone else's country \u2014 because they thought it made them look strong. Then they turned around and told us we can\u2019t \"afford\" nation-building right here at home.\n\nIt\u2019s time for this broken status quo to come to an end. We can\u2019t let the same crooks and liars who got us into these pointless wars continue calling the shots in Congress. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for U.S. Senate in Missouri. It\u2019s time for a people-powered movement to fight back.\n\nTogether, we can end these pointless wars and invest in our own communities. My campaign isn\u2019t accepting a dime of corporate PAC money, so we\u2019re relying on grassroots folks chipping in what they can to help power our movement. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking: can you contribute any amount right now to my campaign?",

Some politicians are telling us now isn't the time to speak frankly about Afghanistan. I'm not surprised.\n\nFor decades, elites told the American people we were winning this war. Later, they told us while Iraq was wrong, Afghanistan was the war worth fighting. They told us it was worth the lives, worth the money, worth the time. It was all lies.\n\nI\u2019ve always said one of the hardest parts of my deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan was coming home to my old neighborhood in Cole County, Missouri. Empty lots, abandoned buildings, a gutted Midwest. Our own communities look like battlefields after decades of economic warfare waged by corrupt politicians and massive corporations.\n\nThey spent $6.4 trillion in taxpayer dollars sending soldiers like me out to fight on a doomed mission to build up someone else's country \u2014 because they thought it made them look strong. Then they turned around and told us we can\u2019t \"afford\" nation-building right here at home.\n\nIt\u2019s time for this broken status quo to come to an end. We can\u2019t let the same crooks and liars who got us into these pointless wars continue calling the shots in Congress. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for U.S. Senate in Missouri. It\u2019s time for a people-powered movement to fight back.\n\nTogether, we can end these pointless wars and invest in our own communities. My campaign isn\u2019t accepting a dime of corporate PAC money, so we\u2019re relying on grassroots folks chipping in what they can to help power our movement. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking: can you contribute any amount right now to my campaign?",

Some politicians are telling us now isn't the time to speak frankly about Afghanistan. I'm not surprised.\n\nFor decades, elites told the American people we were winning this war. Later, they told us while Iraq was wrong, Afghanistan was the war worth fighting. They told us it was worth the lives, worth the money, worth the time. It was all lies.\n\nI\u2019ve always said one of the hardest parts of my deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan was coming home to my old neighborhood in Cole County, Missouri. Empty lots, abandoned buildings, a gutted Midwest. Our own communities look like battlefields after decades of economic warfare waged by corrupt politicians and massive corporations.\n\nThey spent $6.4 trillion in taxpayer dollars sending soldiers like me out to fight on a doomed mission to build up someone else's country \u2014 because they thought it made them look strong. Then they turned around and told us we can\u2019t \"afford\" nation-building right here at home.\n\nIt\u2019s time for this broken status quo to come to an end. We can\u2019t let the same crooks and liars who got us into these pointless wars continue calling the shots in Congress. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for U.S. Senate in Missouri. It\u2019s time for a people-powered movement to fight back.\n\nTogether, we can end these pointless wars and invest in our own communities. My campaign isn\u2019t accepting a dime of corporate PAC money, so we\u2019re relying on grassroots folks chipping in what they can to help power our movement. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking: can you contribute any amount right now to my campaign?",

Each member of the Texas House of Representatives receives a per diem of $221 or $6,630 per month, and these members have yet to reimburse the Texas taxpayers.\n\n\u201cTexans do not pay taxes so their representatives can take sight-seeing tours in Washington or gallivant across Europe,\u201d said THRC Chairman, Jim Murphy (R-Houston). \u201cThey pay taxes to have representation in Austin on issues that matter like foster care grants, retired teacher funding and bail reform. It is past time for these 48 Democrats to return the money they took from taxpayers while avoiding their jobs. If they wish to be paid to vacation, I suggest they find new work as Instagram influencers.\u201d  \n\nThe failure of these Democrats to show up over the course of the first special session and a portion of the second special session has cost the taxpayers nearly three-quarters of $1 million and is increasing daily.\n\nAccording to the House Business Office, the list of vacationing Democrats who have yet to return their taxpayer funded per diem as of August 20, 2021 includes:\nRep.

This weekend Morgan Harper and our team were at the Ohio Classic to get the word out about the campaign. That\u2019s when she was approached by someone who wanted to give her a compliment about her looks.\n\nMorgan (politely) shut \ud83d\udc4f it \ud83d\udc4f down \ud83d\udc4f with a simple, \"Oh, thank you. But I\u2019m also running for U.S. Senate, so more importantly you need to make sure you\u2019re paying attention to my Senate race.\"\n\nMorgan is not an establishment insider. She also doesn\u2019t look like the candidates who\u2019ve come before. She\u2019d be the first Black person and the first woman ever elected to represent Ohio in the U.S. Senate. She\u2019d also be the only Black woman at all sitting in today\u2019s U.S. Senate. \n\nOhio deserves a leader who will stand up for them in the U.S. Senate, not special interests. Morgan is the only candidate in this race not taking a dime of corporate or Super PAC money. This campaign is powered by small-dollar donations. Can you donate to our grassroots movement to help keep our campaign strong and ensure we have the resources we need to get the word out about our progressive campaign?",
