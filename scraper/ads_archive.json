         "ad_creative_body": "These things don't just happen on their own.  It started with asking the great citizens of Newton what they wanted their town to be - What was important to them - what would they use and be proud of?\n\nThere has been some very intensive planning that went into this and other projects that are on the table.  Debt has been refinanced to take advantage of lower rates saving several million dollars.  Balancing new project implementation with the payoffs of other projects is vital to maintain a level budget - we have done that.  Digging deep to cut expenses - yet maintaining equipment replacement and infrastructure maintenance & improvement programs - we have done that.  \n\nWe know that people complain about many things - things that happened prior to when I became a city commissioner - we've come a long way - but we still have a lot of work ahead.  But know - we are putting in the work - trying to give the citizens what they are asking for - but in a way that doesn't cause a sharp increase in taxes - but by taking what we have and giving you more for your money.\n\nPlease know we care - I care - I deeply care.  City municipal utility bills are slated to go down after the final 2026 debt payment on the renovated sewage treatment plant.  Mine will go down $ 38 per month.  \n\nPlease bear with me - I want to do this for 4 more years.  I am committed to this path we are on.  No increase in the mill levy for 4 straight years (including 2022) - taxes are high enough.  We just need to take what we already have and make it better.  \n\nI would appreciate your support on November 3rd.\n\nBut now - I have to leave to take a dip in our new pool!",

Some politicians are telling us now isn't the time to speak frankly about Afghanistan. I'm not surprised.\n\nFor decades, elites told the American people we were winning this war. Later, they told us while Iraq was wrong, Afghanistan was the war worth fighting. They told us it was worth the lives, worth the money, worth the time. It was all lies.\n\nI\u2019ve always said one of the hardest parts of my deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan was coming home to my old neighborhood in Cole County, Missouri. Empty lots, abandoned buildings, a gutted Midwest. Our own communities look like battlefields after decades of economic warfare waged by corrupt politicians and massive corporations.\n\nThey spent $6.4 trillion in taxpayer dollars sending soldiers like me out to fight on a doomed mission to build up someone else's country \u2014 because they thought it made them look strong. Then they turned around and told us we can\u2019t \"afford\" nation-building right here at home.\n\nIt\u2019s time for this broken status quo to come to an end. We can\u2019t let the same crooks and liars who got us into these pointless wars continue calling the shots in Congress. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for U.S. Senate in Missouri. It\u2019s time for a people-powered movement to fight back.\n\nTogether, we can end these pointless wars and invest in our own communities. My campaign isn\u2019t accepting a dime of corporate PAC money, so we\u2019re relying on grassroots folks chipping in what they can to help power our movement. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking: can you contribute any amount right now to my campaign?",

Some politicians are telling us now isn't the time to speak frankly about Afghanistan. I'm not surprised.\n\nFor decades, elites told the American people we were winning this war. Later, they told us while Iraq was wrong, Afghanistan was the war worth fighting. They told us it was worth the lives, worth the money, worth the time. It was all lies.\n\nI\u2019ve always said one of the hardest parts of my deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan was coming home to my old neighborhood in Cole County, Missouri. Empty lots, abandoned buildings, a gutted Midwest. Our own communities look like battlefields after decades of economic warfare waged by corrupt politicians and massive corporations.\n\nThey spent $6.4 trillion in taxpayer dollars sending soldiers like me out to fight on a doomed mission to build up someone else's country \u2014 because they thought it made them look strong. Then they turned around and told us we can\u2019t \"afford\" nation-building right here at home.\n\nIt\u2019s time for this broken status quo to come to an end. We can\u2019t let the same crooks and liars who got us into these pointless wars continue calling the shots in Congress. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for U.S. Senate in Missouri. It\u2019s time for a people-powered movement to fight back.\n\nTogether, we can end these pointless wars and invest in our own communities. My campaign isn\u2019t accepting a dime of corporate PAC money, so we\u2019re relying on grassroots folks chipping in what they can to help power our movement. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking: can you contribute any amount right now to my campaign?",

It was all lies.\n\nI\u2019ve always said one of the hardest parts of my deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan was coming home to my old neighborhood in Cole County, Missouri. Empty lots, abandoned buildings, a gutted Midwest. Our own communities look like battlefields after decades of economic warfare waged by corrupt politicians and massive corporations.\n\nThey spent $6.4 trillion in taxpayer dollars sending soldiers like me out to fight on a doomed mission to build up someone else's country \u2014 because they thought it made them look strong. Then they turned around and told us we can\u2019t \"afford\" nation-building right here at home.\n\nIt\u2019s time for this broken status quo to come to an end. We can\u2019t let the same crooks and liars who got us into these pointless wars continue calling the shots in Congress. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for U.S. Senate in Missouri. It\u2019s time for a people-powered movement to fight back.\n\nTogether, we can end these pointless wars and invest in our own communities. My campaign isn\u2019t accepting a dime of corporate PAC money, so we\u2019re relying on grassroots folks chipping in what they can to help power our movement. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking: can you contribute any amount right now to my campaign?",
