So they hide behind anonymous attacks, trying to tear down AOC and everything she has accomplished. \n\nBased on the millions in dark money spent against us during our 2020 re-election campaign, we can expect that the amount spent against us will only increase. So this month, we\u2019re setting a goal to raise exactly $140,833.33 from this post to show these dark money groups how powerful our grassroots movement is.

This year alone, Republican Super PACs have already spent $140,833.33 in attacks against Alexandria. Our grassroots movement terrifies the billionaires behind these dark money groups. So they hide behind anonymous attacks, trying to tear down AOC and everything she has accomplished. \n\nBased on the millions in dark money spent against us during our 2020 re-election campaign, we can expect that the amount spent against us will only increase. So this month, we\u2019re setting a goal to raise exactly $140,833.33 from this post to show these dark money groups how powerful our grassroots movement is. Chip in $10 before our official FEC end-of-quarter fundraising deadline, and together, we can outraise these Republican groups.",

This year alone, Republican Super PACs have already spent $140,833.33 in attacks against Alexandria. Our grassroots movement terrifies the billionaires behind these dark money groups. So they hide behind anonymous attacks, trying to tear down AOC and everything she has accomplished. \n\nBased on the millions in dark money spent against us during our 2020 re-election campaign, we can expect that the amount spent against us will only increase. So this month, we\u2019re setting a goal to raise exactly $140,833.33 from this post to show these dark money groups how powerful our grassroots movement is. Chip in $10 before our official FEC end-of-quarter fundraising deadline, and together, we can outraise these Republican groups.",

This year alone, Republican Super PACs have already spent $140,833.33 in attacks against Alexandria. Our grassroots movement terrifies the billionaires behind these dark money groups. So they hide behind anonymous attacks, trying to tear down AOC and everything she has accomplished. \n\nBased on the millions in dark money spent against us during our 2020 re-election campaign, we can expect that the amount spent against us will only increase. So this month, we\u2019re setting a goal to raise exactly $140,833.33 from this post to show these dark money groups how powerful our grassroots movement is. Chip in $10 before our official FEC end-of-quarter fundraising deadline, and together, we can outraise these Republican groups.",

This year alone, Republican Super PACs have already spent $140,833.33 in attacks against Alexandria. Our grassroots movement terrifies the billionaires behind these dark money groups. So they hide behind anonymous attacks, trying to tear down AOC and everything she has accomplished. \n\nBased on the millions in dark money spent against us during our 2020 re-election campaign, we can expect that the amount spent against us will only increase. So this month, we\u2019re setting a goal to raise exactly $140,833.33 from this post to show these dark money groups how powerful our grassroots movement is. Chip in $10 before our official FEC end-of-quarter fundraising deadline, and together, we can outraise these Republican groups.",

This year alone, Republican Super PACs have already spent $140,833.33 in attacks against Alexandria. Our grassroots movement terrifies the billionaires behind these dark money groups. So they hide behind anonymous attacks, trying to tear down AOC and everything she has accomplished. \n\nBased on the millions in dark money spent against us during our 2020 re-election campaign, we can expect that the amount spent against us will only increase. So this month, we\u2019re setting a goal to raise exactly $140,833.33 from this post to show these dark money groups how powerful our grassroots movement is. Chip in $10 before our official FEC end-of-quarter fundraising deadline, and together, we can outraise these Republican groups.",
